Most scripts and programs similar to this set 755 recursively when setting 
permissions on kexts. I believe this to be an oversight. kextcache 
/does not/ need or expect 755 and recursively setting this is wrong as there
is no inherent reason that plists and *all* other coincidental files need to
be world executable by default.

While there's no functional harm in setting 755 recursively and in fact may 
actually help some users who are confused by poorly-packaged kexts and 
strange permission-related kextcache and runtime errors; the best practice
is to avoid it all together because it exposes an unnecessary attack surface.

If we really wanted to nanny, we could iterate through each opaque kext
folder and set permissions based on filetype magic. However, if you're
putting your faith in a third party kernel developer, you should probably
also trust their ability to know how to package their releases correctly.
 
To put it bluntly, if you're blindly installing an unverified kext from a
third party to get wifi on your, 'LOL HACKINTOSH NETBOOK' working, this
program is probably not for you.
